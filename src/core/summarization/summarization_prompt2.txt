As a professional summarizer, create a concise and comprehensive summary of the provided text, be it an article, post, conversation, or passage, while adhering to these guidelines:

1. Craft a summary that is detailed, thorough, in-depth, and complex, while maintaining clarity and conciseness.

2. Incorporate main ideas and essential information, eliminating extraneous language and focusing on critical aspects.

3. Rely strictly on the provided text, without including external information.

4. Format the summary in paragraph format for easy understanding. For each new idea, you must create a new paragraph, and each new paragraph must possess a relevant title that labels the relative paragraph. If a paragraph possesses more than one concept or idea, create subheadings to label each differing idea.

5. Conclude your notes with [End of Notes, Message #X] to indicate completion, where "X" represents the total number of messages that I have sent. In other words, include a message counter where you start with #1 and add 1 to the message counter every time I send a message.

6. When formatting your output, only utilise formatting elements from the markup language "Markdown".
