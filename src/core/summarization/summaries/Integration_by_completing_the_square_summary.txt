Main Topics Covered:
1. Finding the anti-derivative of the function 1/(x^2 - 8x + 1)
2. Using the technique of completing the square
3. Applying trigonometric substitution to simplify the integral

Key Points and Details:
- Completing the square is used to rewrite the function in a form suitable for trigonometric substitution.
- The goal is to rewrite the function in terms of trigonometric functions for easier integration.
- Trigonometric substitution involves selecting the appropriate substitution and finding the corresponding differential term.
- Simplifying the expression using trigonometric identities such as secant, tangent, and cosecant.
- Drawing a triangle to relate the variables x and theta for the final substitution.
- The final step involves integrating the simplified expression in terms of theta and then converting the result back to x using the triangle relationship.
