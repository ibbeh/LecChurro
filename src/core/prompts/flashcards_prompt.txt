Based on the following lecture transcription, generate a set of flashcards to help a student learn.

Each flashcard should have:
- A question or term on the front (this will be called "Front").
- The answer or definition on the back (this will be called "Back").

Do not produce any extra formatting like HTML or code blocks. Just produce a list of "Front: ..." and "Back: ...". Keep each card in consecutive lines, e.g.:

Front: What is the imaginary unit 'i'?
Back: It is the square root of -1.

Front: Define a complex number.
Back: A complex number has a real part and an imaginary part.

Guidelines:
1. Follow this format exactly: 
   Front: [Question or Term]
   Back: [Answer or Definition]
   Example:
   Front: What is the imaginary unit 'i'?
   Back: It is the square root of -1.

2. Keep each flashcard concise and to the point, avoiding overly long explanations.

3. Focus only on the content provided in the lecture transcription. Do not include any additional commentary or information not found in the transcription.

4. Generate approximately 10â€“20 flashcards (or as many as appropriate based on the transcription and length of the lecture content).

5. If any part of the transcription is unclear or vague, skip it and focus on the clear content.
