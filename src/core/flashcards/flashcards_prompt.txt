Based on the following lecture transcription, generate a set of flashcards to help a student learn.

Each flashcard should have:
- A question or term on the front (this will be called "Front").
- The answer or definition on the back (this will be called "Back").

Do not produce any extra formatting like HTML or code blocks. Just produce a list of "Front: ..." and "Back: ...". Keep each card in consecutive lines, e.g.:

Front: What is the imaginary unit 'i'?
Back: It is the square root of -1.

Front: Define a complex number.
Back: A complex number has a real part and an imaginary part.
